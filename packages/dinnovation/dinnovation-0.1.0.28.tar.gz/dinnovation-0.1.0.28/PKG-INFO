## Dinnovation Architecture

![dinnovation_module](https://github.com/cmblir/dinnovation/assets/75519839/9349976d-8774-4831-b17e-716d9a3f3498)
- Dinnovation's architecture is built on efficiency. Data from multiple sites can be collected, processed, and loaded with one module.

## Dinnovation Process

![auto_process](https://github.com/cmblir/dinnovation/assets/75519839/b0fba513-de33-49b2-96a6-b182ca5965d7)
- Dinnovation's Auto Process automatically collects, processes, and loads data using the scheduler. This can be done more efficiently than simply using a module.


## Dinnovation Workflow

![github_workflow](https://github.com/cmblir/dinnovation/assets/75519839/462facc4-8926-481b-8963-8c55f7941ddb)
- Dinnovation's workflow was created by a single developer. This will automatically update the package and the release of Github when you modify the code and upload it to Git for the efficiency of your work. In addition, version management is also automatically.
