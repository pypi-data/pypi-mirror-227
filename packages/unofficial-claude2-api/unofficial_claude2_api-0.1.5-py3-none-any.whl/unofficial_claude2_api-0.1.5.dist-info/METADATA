pip uninstall unofficial-claude2-api
```

## Requirements
#### These requirements are needed to auto retrieve session cookie and UserAgent using selenium

 - [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) installed inside a folder registered in PATH environment variable.

_______

## Example Usage

```python
from claude2_api.client import (
    ClaudeAPIClient,
    get_session_data,
    MessageRateLimitHit,
)

FILEPATH = "test.txt"

# This function will automatically retrieve a SessionData instance using selenium
# Omitting profile argument will use default Firefox profile
data = get_session_data()

# Initialize a client instance using a session
client = ClaudeAPIClient(data)

# Create a new chat and cache the chat_id
chat_id = client.create_chat()
if not chat_id:
    # This will not throw MessageRateLimitHit
    # But it still means that account has no more messages left.
    print(f"\nMessage limit hit, cannot create chat...")
    quit()

try:
    # Used for sending message with or without attachment
    # Returns a SendMessageResponse instance
    res = client.send_message(chat_id, "Hello!", attachment_path=FILEPATH, timeout=240)
    # Inspect answer
    if res.answer:
        print(res.answer)
    else:
        # Inspect response status code and json error
        print(f"\nError code {res.status_code}, response -> {res.error_response}")
except MessageRateLimitHit as e:
    # The exception will hold these informations about the rate limit:
    print(f"\nMessage limit hit, resets at {e.resetDate}")
    print(f"\n{e.sleep_sec} seconds left until -> {e.resetTimestamp}")
    quit()
finally:
    # Perform chat deletion for cleanup
    client.delete_chat(chat_id)

# Get a list of all chats ids
all_chat_ids = client.get_all_chat_ids()
# Delete all chats
for chat in all_chat_ids:
    client.delete_chat(chat)

# Or by using a shortcut utility
#
# client.delete_all_chats()
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

This api will sometime return a 403 status_code when calling `send_message`, when this happens it is recommeded to look for these things:
- Check if your IP location is allowed, should be in US/UK, other locations may work sporadically.

- Don't try to send the same prompt/file over and over again, instead wait for some time, and change input.
