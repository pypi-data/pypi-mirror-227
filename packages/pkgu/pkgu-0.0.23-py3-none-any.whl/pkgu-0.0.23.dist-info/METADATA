# pkgu

Find the out-dated packages installed by the Pip tool and update them. Inspired by ðŸ‘‰[depu(Go)](https://github.com/kevwan/depu).
However, `pkgu` supports full and partial updates, which is more convenient and flexible.

## Usage

- Run code from source code

First, you need to install dependencies.

if you don't have `poetry` tool, please install it first. ðŸ”—: [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), otherwise, install packages directly.

```bash
poetry install
```

and then, run `pkgu.py` script.

```bash
python3 pkgu.py
```

- Use it through pip

```bash
pip3 install pkgu
```

after the installation is complete, `pkgu` executable file will be written to the python bin directory and you can enter `pkgu -h` command on your terminal to learn how to use it.

## ScreenShoot

> 1. No packages need to be upgraded.

> 2. Upgrade some expired packages.

> 3. Update the pkg synchronously

> 4. Update the pkg asynchronously

![img_5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abeautifulsnow/pkgu/main/screenshoot/img_5.png)

We can see that the async method is faster than sync method about 9 seconds(Only in this test situation).
So now it can support to update the python libraries asynchronously. ðŸ¥³

> 5. Support for selectable update packages

* List all availbable packages

* Select ths part of package to be updated

> 6. !!!New - Support to use cache result from sqlite db file.

This improve the expirence that how we list the out-dated packages when they are huge to collect, and then there also is a cli flag `--no-cache` to control whether should to use cache.
