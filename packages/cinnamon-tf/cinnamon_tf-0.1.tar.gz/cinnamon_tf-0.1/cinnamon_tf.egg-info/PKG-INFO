Description: # Cinnamon Tensorflow package
        
        The tensorflow package offers ``Component`` and related ``Configuration`` that rely on the Tensorflow library.
        
        Thus, ``cinnamon-tf`` mainly provides ``Model``, ``Callback`` and ``Helper`` implementations.
        
        ## Components and Configurations
        
        The tensorflow package defines the following ``Component`` and ``Configuration``
        
        - Neural networks: a high-level implementation to build your tensorflow-based neural models.
        - Callbacks (e.g., early stopping)
        - Framework helpers for tensorflow/cuda deterministic behaviour
        
        ## Install
        
        pip
        
              pip install cinnamon-tf
        
        git
        
              git clone https://github.com/federicoruggeri/cinnamon_tf
        
        ## Contribute
        
        Want to contribute with new ``Component`` and ``Configuration``?
