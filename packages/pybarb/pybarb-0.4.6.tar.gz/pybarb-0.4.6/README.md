# pybarb

A python package for interacting with [BARB's web API](https://barb-api.co.uk/api-docs).

## About Barb

Barb is the industryâ€™s standard for understanding what people watch.

Barb's hybrid approach integrates people-based panel data with census-level online viewing data. Barb's methodology enables them to deliver inclusive measurement of total identified viewing across all broadcast, VOD and video-sharing platforms, delivered onto and consumed via multiple platforms and devices.

As the past, present and future of total viewing measurement, Barb is uniquely placed to empower transformation of the UK TV and advertising ecosystem, through integrated audience data and actionable insights.

## About the Barb API

The Barb Application Programming Interface (API) enables Barb subscribers and underwriters to access Barb data directly for ingestion into internal tools and systems.

There are three main endpoints available:

- GET: /audiences_by_time - Audience sizes for various time periods by day, station and panel

- GET: /programme_ratings - Audience ratings data for broadcasted content by day, station and panel

- GET: /advertising_spots - Get the audience ratings data for advertising spots by day, station and panel

There are additional endpoints for users to look up Stations, Panel numbers, Advertisers and Media buying agencies for use with the main endpoints.

The data in the API are enriched with metadata from Barb and Clearcast on programmes and adverts.

*Important:* As the licence states, code is provided 'as is'. It is the user's responsibility to check the code and the outputs.
