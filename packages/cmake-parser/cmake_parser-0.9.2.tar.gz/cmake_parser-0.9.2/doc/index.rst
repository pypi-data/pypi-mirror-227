cmake_parser
============

:mod:`cmake_parser` is a pure Python parser for CMake code. It is still work in progress,
but is reasonably usable. It provides the following features:

* AST representation of CMake code
* Correct handling of quoted and bracketed values
* Variable expansion
* Basic boolean expression evaluation

Notably missing but planned are:

* Some operators for boolean expressions
* Generator expression support
* Script engine for convenient CMake execution within Python
