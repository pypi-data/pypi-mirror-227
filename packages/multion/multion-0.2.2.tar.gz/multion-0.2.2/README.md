# MULTIÂ·ON API 

Welcome to the MultiOn API Repository ðŸš€

The MultiOn API enables building custom AI Agents & Applications that can take actions on the Web as easy as a few lines of code.

See [Examples](https://github.com/MULTI-ON/api/tree/main/examples) to get started.


## Use
We provide a Python and JS SDK to build on top of the MultiOn API and can directly be also used from [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/multion).

**Minimum supported version of langchain to run the langchain examples: v0.0.265**
