    """
    Calculates an average treatment effect as a difference between the outcome means of
    the treated and control sets. Positive TE means that he treatment increased the
    outcome, negative - decreased.

    Because for one individual not both treated and control outcomes can be measured,
    the ATE for a treated set with N and a control set with M elements is computed as
    follows:
    .. math::
         \text{ATE} = \frac {1}{N} \\sum_i y_1(i) - \frac {1}{M} \\sum_j y_0(j),

    where y_1(i), y_0(j) are outcome values for one treated and control observation each

    For the matched set the formula stays:

    .. math::
         \text{ATE} = \frac {1}{N} \\sum_i y_1(i) - \frac {1}{M} \\sum_j y_0(j)
                    = \frac {1}{N} (\\sum_i y_1(i) - y_0(i)) if N = M

    Calculates the Cohenâ€™s D (standardized mean difference). It measures the effect size

    A d of i indicates the two groups differ by i standard deviations. Standard
    deviations are equivalent to z-scores (1 standard deviation = 1 z-score).
