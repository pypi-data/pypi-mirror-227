## Batch app
This repo contains batch codes to collect data from many top job postings sites in Vietnam such as Indeed VN, VietnamWorks, TopCV, ...

We use Github Actions to collect the data automatically.
Please note that, some websites in Vietnam have mechanisms to prevent scrappers like bots, therefore, we must keep retrying every 5 minutes.

Currently, the list of website we are collecting data from is as follows.

| Website        | URL                                                  | Batch from | Batch cron              | Queries                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| TopCV          | [https://www.topcv.vn](https://www.topcv.vn)         | 2023-08-19 | `59 12 * * *` or manual | `ai engineer`, `computer vision`, `machine learning` |
| VietnamWorks   | [https://vietnamworks.com](https://vietnamworks.com) | 2023-08-19 | `59 12 * * *` or manual | `ai engineer`, `computer vision`, `machine learning` |
| Indeed Vietnam | [https://vn.indeed.com](https://vn.indeed.com)       | 2023-08-19 | `59 12 * * *` or manual | `ai engineer`, `computer vision`, `machine learning` |


## Online app

Besides the batch app which is setup in Github Actions to crawl data daily, we provide an online app 
to test the scenarios of data collected.
We use MongoDB to store the data collections. To setup an environment for analysing data, see [mongodb environment setup](./scripts/mongodb).

To run the online app:

```bash
$ python uninstall aijobs_batch
$ python setup.py install
$ aijobs_online --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000 --log_level info
```
