Description
-----------

Piccol is a graphical tool to pick a pixel color from anywhere on the screen and then show the color details as

* RGB decimal notation
* RGB hex notation
* HLS decimal notation
* and as written text (e.g. "very saturated light blue")

The RGB and HLS values can also be altered via sliders to create a correspondingly colored pixel.


Image import
------------

Images can be imported to piccol to analyze the image pixels.
