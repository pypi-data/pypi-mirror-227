## Retry Utilities

The `retry` module provides functionality to automatically retry function calls, both synchronous and asynchronous, in the event of exceptions. This is particularly useful when interacting with systems that might temporarily fail and then succeed upon retry.

### Key Features

- `retry_call`: A function to automatically retry a synchronous function call upon exception.
- `retry_call_async`: The asynchronous counterpart to `retry_call`, for retrying asynchronous functions.

### Usage Examples

**`retry_call`:**

```python
from senstile_utils.retry import retry_call
import random

def sometimes_fail():
    if random.random() > 0.5:
        raise ValueError("Failed!")
    return "Success!"

# Use retry_call to attempt the function multiple times before giving up
result = retry_call(sometimes_fail, max_trials=5, delay_ms=500)
print(result)
```

**`retry_call_async`:**

```python
import asyncio
from senstile_utils.retry import retry_call_async
import random

async def sometimes_fail_async():
    if random.random() > 0.5:
        raise ValueError("Failed!")
    return "Async Success!"

# Use retry_call_async to attempt the async function multiple times
result = asyncio.run(retry_call_async(sometimes_fail_async, max_trials=5, delay_ms=500))
print(result)
```

## Event Emitter

The `EventEmitter` class provides a mechanism to implement the publish-subscribe pattern in Python. This design allows components of a system to communicate with each other without requiring them to be tightly coupled. Subscribers can react to events without direct knowledge of the publisher.

### Key Features

- **subscribe**: Subscribe to a specific topic and register a callback to be invoked when an event is emitted for that topic.
- **emit**: Emit an event to a specific topic, causing all registered callbacks for that topic to be invoked.
- **unsubscribe**: Unsubscribe a callback from a specific topic, preventing it from being invoked for future events on that topic.

### Usage Examples

```python
from senstile_utils.event import EventEmitter

# Instantiate an EventEmitter
emitter = EventEmitter()

# Define callback functions
def on_data_received(topic, data):
    print(f"Data received on topic {topic}: {data}")

def another_callback(topic, data):
    print(f"Another callback for topic {topic}: {data}")

# Subscribe callbacks to a topic
subscription1 = emitter.subscribe("topic1", on_data_received)
subscription2 = emitter.subscribe("topic1", another_callback)

# Emit an event to a topic
emitter.emit("topic1", {"message":"Data received",data:[1,0.9,0,1,2],user:"user@example.com"})

# Unsubscribe a callback from a topic
subscription1.unsubscribe()
```

## Observer

The `Observer` class is a cornerstone of the Observer pattern. It allows an object to publish changes to its state so that other objects can react in response. This pattern is beneficial for scenarios where a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed.

### Key Features

- **subscribe**: Register an observer callback which gets notified of changes in the subject's state. Optionally, the newly subscribed observer can immediately get the current state.
- **next**: Notify all observers with new data.
- **update**: Update the Observer's internal data using a callback and notify all observers of the change.
- **getData**: Retrieve the current data of the Observer.

### Usage Examples

```python
from senstile_utils.observer import Observer

# Instantiate an Observer
obs = Observer(data=5)

# Define callback functions
def print_data(data):
    print(f"Received data: {data}")

def multiply_data(data):
    return data*2

# Subscribe callbacks to the observer
subscription = obs.subscribe(print_data, get_current=True)

# Update the observer's data and notify all subscribers
obs.update(multiply_data)

# Unsubscribe a callback
subscription.unsubscribe()

```
## Config Class

The `Config` class is a singleton utility that provides capabilities to load and access application configurations. This class is primarily designed to read from configuration files and can additionally validate configurations against a provided schema.

### Key Features

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that only one instance of the configuration is created and used throughout the application.
- **Schema Validation**: Validates loaded configuration data against a provided schema.
- **Cache**: Caches previously accessed configuration values for faster subsequent accesses.
- **Flexible Initialization**: Uses the PYTHON_ENV environment variable to determine which configuration to load but provides a default if it isn't set.

### Usage Examples

Initialization
To initialize and access configurations:

```python
config = Config()
db_host = config.get("database.host")
```

Or loading from a path

```python
config_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'config_files')
 config = Config(config_path_dir=config_dir)
db_host = config.get("database.host") # the same than data["database"]["host"]
```

Note: If the `PYTHON_ENV` environment variable is not set, it defaults to using the 'local' configuration that will load the `config.toml` file.
