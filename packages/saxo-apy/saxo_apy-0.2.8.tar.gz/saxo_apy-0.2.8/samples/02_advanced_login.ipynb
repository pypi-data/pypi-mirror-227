    "## Authenticating a Deployed Application Behind a Reverse Proxy with HTTPS Enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example the redirect to the server listening on port 12321 uses the insecure HTTP protocol. The user's browser can therefore not verify that the machine it's connecting to _is_ actually `my-dev-box.my-domain.net`. This poses a security risk because the `auth_code` param that is included in the redirect could potentially fall into the wrong hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure security, we need to redirect to: `https://my-dev-box.my-domain.net` instead (notice HTTP**S** instead of HTTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires the following steps:\n",
    "- The devbox needs some reverse proxy to offload SSL. In this example I am using Nginx with Let's Encrypt/Certbot on an Ubuntu machine (for an excellent tutorial on how to set this up, see DigitalOcean's setup [guide 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) and [guide 2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-20-04)).\n",
    "- The app config needs to be updated with a new redirect url: `https://my-dev-box.my-domain.net:443/redirect` (notice HTTP**S** and port=443).\n",
    "- We need to configure the `saxo-apy` redirect server to listen on a different port, because port 443 will be used by Nginx to receive incoming traffic (which is then proxy'd to the redirect server).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nginx configuration for your domain should be extended with some `proxy_pass` redirect such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    location /redirect {\n",
    "        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/redirect;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will receive incoming (SSL-secured) traffic on the route to `/redirect` and forward the request to localhost port 8080. This will be the location where our redirect server is catching the request to handle the next steps of the authorization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can connect our application to Saxo securely over HTTPS. Make sure to update your local copy of the application configuration (which should have the new redirect URL specified above)."
