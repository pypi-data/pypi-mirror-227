mappersession releases live on https://pypi.org/project/mappersession/

contact bradyboettcher@gmail.com about getting access if you're continuing work on the project :)

We use the hatch python library to build the wheel, then upload to PyPI using twine.

Making a new release: 

1. Bump the version in pyproject.toml and tag with git with the same version number
    - e.g., `git tag v0.2.1` then `git push origin v0.2.1`
    - The README.md will display on the PyPI package, so update it with any notable changes
2. Build the python wheel (on any platform) with:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
```

3. Run `python -m twine upload dist/<generated_wheel_name>.whl`
4. Enter __token__ for the username, and copy your PyPI token (unique to your account) for the password
5. Visit https://pypi.org/project/mappersession/ to confirm the release looks good!
