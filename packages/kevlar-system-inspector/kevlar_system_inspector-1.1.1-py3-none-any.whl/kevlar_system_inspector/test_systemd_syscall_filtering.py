Application Sandboxing
----------------------

Application sandboxing is the process of isolating applications from the rest
of the system to prevent rogue applications from accessing or modifying
sensitive resources. Attackers will attempt to use a vulnerable application to
escalate privileges and/or execute malicious code. Such actions tend to be
abnormal, i.e., they do not fit a model of how an application normally
executes. Application sandboxing attempts to create a model of normal
(different techniques are possible) and then detect deviation from the model.

Application sandboxing should be applied to systemd. Systemd services
constitute the userspace core of a running system and as such are primary
targets for attackers. Applying application sandboxing can mitigate the impact
of a compromised systemd service.
