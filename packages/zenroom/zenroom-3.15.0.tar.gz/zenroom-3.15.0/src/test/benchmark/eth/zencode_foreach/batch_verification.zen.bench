Scenario 'ethereum': batch verification

Given I have a 'ethereum address array' named 'ethereum addresses'
and I have a 'ethereum signature array' named 'ethereum signatures'
and I have a 'string' named 'message'

Foreach 'address' in 'ethereum addresses'
and 'signature' in 'ethereum signatures'
When I verify the 'message' has a ethereum signature in 'signature' by 'address'
EndForeach

Then print the string 'OK'
