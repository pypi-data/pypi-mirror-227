## Our Open-Source Philosophy

At Octris LLC, we deeply believe in the transformative power of open-source software. Open-source, to us, is more than
just a methodology—it's a philosophy that heralds transparency, community-driven progress, and an ethos of shared
innovation.

Our support particularly leans towards permissive licenses like MIT, which we feel best embody our vision of unhindered
collaboration and freedom in software distribution and modification. While we respect the intentions behind copyleft
licenses like GPLv3, our preference lies with licenses that minimize restrictions, fostering a more inclusive and
adaptive tech ecosystem. By aligning ourselves with such licenses, Octris LLC reaffirms its commitment to creating and
supporting platforms where technology is not just accessible and open, but also freely adaptable to the diverse needs of
users across the globe.
