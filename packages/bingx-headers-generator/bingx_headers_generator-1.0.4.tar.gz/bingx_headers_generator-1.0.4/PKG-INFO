# How did I find out how to generate headers?

In one of their site files(**https://bin.bb-os.com/_nuxt/1491b29.js**) I found interesting function - `function wt(e)` Go check it and you follow other functions that are called in `wt()` and I'm sure you will start to understand the whole process of generating headers
