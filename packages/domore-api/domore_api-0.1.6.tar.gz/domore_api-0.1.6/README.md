## Design Philosophy

- Convention over configuration
- ROI matters
- Embrace open source, leverage [`requests`][requests], [`pytest`][pytest], [`pydantic`][pydantic], [`allure`][allure], [`pytest-html`][pytest-html] and [`locust`][locust].

## Key Features

- [x] Inherit all powerful features of [`requests`][requests], just have fun to handle HTTP(S) in human way.
- [x] Define testcase in YAML or JSON format, run with [`pytest`][pytest] in concise and elegant manner.
- [x] Record and generate testcases with [`HAR`][HAR] support.
- [x] Supports `variables`/`extract`/`validate`/`hooks` mechanisms to create extremely complex test scenarios.
- [x] With `debugtalk.py` plugin, any function can be used in any part of your testcase.
- [x] With [`jmespath`][jmespath], extract and validate json response has never been easier.
- [x] With [`pytest`][pytest], hundreds of plugins are readily available.
- [x] With [`allure`][allure] or [`pytest-html`][pytest-html], test report can be pretty nice and powerful.
- [x] With reuse of [`locust`][locust], you can run performance test without extra work.
- [x] CLI command supported, perfect combination with `CI/CD`.
