Welcome

This project will be for efficiently processing images for eBay

Open a terminal and run the following command

```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbusillo/ebay_pictures_tool/main/installer.sh)"```

If you get an error saying the following accompanied by a pop up window, click install, then run the command again.

```xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at `Applications/Xcode.app`, requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.```

Both of these commands will take a while to run, so be patient.
