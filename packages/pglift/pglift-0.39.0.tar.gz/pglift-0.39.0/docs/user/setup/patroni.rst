Patroni
=======

PostgreSQL high availability is achieved by using the `patroni` plugin of
pglift. This needs to be set up through a non-``null`` value for the
``patroni`` key in site settings:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni: {}

With the above settings, pglift assumes that an *open* etcd server is
available at ``127.0.0.1:2379``. It may be required to configure the etcd
hosts address:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni:
      etcd:
        hosts:
        - 192.168.60.21:2379
        - 192.168.60.21:2380

Security
--------

Protecting Etcd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Via site settings, it's possible to secure communication between Patroni
and etcd via TLS.

The settings would look like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni:
      [因
      etcd:
        protocol: https
        cacert: /path/to/cacert.crt
        cert: /path/to/client.crt
        key: /path/to/client.key

Those settings are actually copied to the etcd section in Patroni YAML
configuration file that pglift generates at instance creation.

Protecting the REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To secure the patroni's REST API, the following parameters can be set:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni:
      [因
      restapi:
        cafile: /path/to/cacert.crt
        certfile: /path/to/client.crt
        keyfile: /path/to/client.key
        verify_client: optional

``verify_client`` must be set to either ``required`` or ``optional`` if
certificates are set. Please refer to `patroni' s official documentation
<https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SETTINGS.html#rest-api>`_.

Those settings are actually copied to the ``restapi`` section in Patroni YAML
configuration file that pglift generates at instance creation.

Watchdog support
----------------

One can activate watchdog devices support via site settings. Please refer to
patroni `configuration
<https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SETTINGS.html#watchdog>`_
and `watchdog <https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/watchdog.html>`_
documentation.

Here's an example of settings for watchdog:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni:
      [因
      watchdog:
        mode: required
        device: /dev/watchdog
        safety_margin: 5

pg_rewind support
-----------------

``pg_rewind`` can be activated by adding the following settings:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: settings.yaml

    patroni:
      [因
      use_pg_rewind: true

The corresponding setting will go in the `patroni.postgresql
<https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SETTINGS.html#postgresql>`_ section
in patroni configuration file.
