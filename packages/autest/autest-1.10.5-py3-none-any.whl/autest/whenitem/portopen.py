    Checks to see if a port is open. This function is more like a stat test in that no traffic happens.
    Only a check that the system sees the port is open. Even if the port is open the server may not be
    ready to accept data. If the code to do a netstat test on the system does not exist the code will
    fallback to a PortReady call


    Args:
        port:
            The port to check.
        address:
            The address to bind to.
        timeout:
            How long to wait before timing out. Ignored unless code falls back to PortReady call.
        address_family:
            The family of space to use. Checks both IPv4 and Ipv6 spaces by default ('inet'). For
            the possible values of this string, see the "kind" parameter to
            psutil.net_connections().

        Don't start the curl command until the port on the server is ready
