"""
Classes that describe the state of a simulation at a single point in time

Each state is defined by :attr:`attributes` and :attr:`data`. Attributes describe
general aspects about a state, which typically do not change, e.g., its `name`.
These classes define how data is read and written and they contain methods that can be
used to write multiple states of the same class to a file consecutively, e.g., to store
a trajectory. Here, it is assumed that the `attributes` do not change over time.

All state classes can be sub-classed to adjust to specialized needs. This will often be
necessary if some attributes cannot be serialized automatically or if the data requires
some modifications before storing. To facilitate control over how data is written and
read, we provide the :attr:`~modelrunner.state.base.StateBase._state_attributes_store`
and :attr:`~modelrunner.state.base.StateBase._state_data_store` attributes which should
return respective attributes and data in a form that can be stored directly. When the
object will be restored during reading, the
:meth:`~modelrunner.state.base.StateBase._state_init` method is used to set the
properties of an object.
