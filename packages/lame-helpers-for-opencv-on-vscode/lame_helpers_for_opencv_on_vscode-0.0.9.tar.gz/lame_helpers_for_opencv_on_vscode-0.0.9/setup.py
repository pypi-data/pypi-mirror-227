"""
The objects in this package are useful to practice with python opencv on VScode.

Generally, it is preferable to use Jupiter Notebook to practice with opencv.
This is because JN allows easy ways to manage and display images.
But in case one wants to do the practice with VScode instead of JN, here comes this library.

This is a 'lame' library because the code is not very efficient.
In particular, the function 'cyclical_drawing' might be very CPU and RAM consuming.
