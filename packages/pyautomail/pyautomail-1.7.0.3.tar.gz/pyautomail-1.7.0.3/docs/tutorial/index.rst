Base usage
----------

Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to send a single email:


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/base-usage.py
   :language: python
   :end-before: Creating a sender object


.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/base-usage.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: Creating a sender object
   :end-before: Set the template

CLI Usage
---------

.. note::
   After installation, you can use the command line tool ``pyautomail`` to send emails.

For sending emails, you need to do the following steps:

- register a new process
   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pyautomail register your-email-address path-to-your-contact-list

   this command will return a process-id, which you will use to start the process.
- start the process
   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pyautomail start process-id
