# Unofficial Nitter scraper

This is a simple library to scrape Nitter instances for tweets. It can:

- search and scrape tweets with a certain term

- search and scrape tweets with a certain hashtag

- scrape tweets from a user profile

- get profile information of a user, such as display name, username, number of tweets, profile picture ...

If the instance to use is not provided to the scraper, it will use a random instance among those listed in https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances.

scraper = Nitter(log_level=1)
```
The valid logging levels are:
- None = no logs

- 1 = previous + informational logs (default)

Then, choose the proper function for what you want to do from the following.

## Note

Some Nitter instances may not work properly due to recent changes on Twitter's side. If you have trouble scraping with a certain instance, try changing it and check if the problem persists.
