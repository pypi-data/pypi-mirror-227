# ayo

Run Python "create app" scripts from the web and GitHub repositories.

## Installation

```ps
$ pip install --upgrade ayo
```

## Install & Run A Script

To install and run script(s), you can use the `ayo i` command (which means `install`).

You can either run scripts from GitHub or run them locally from a specific directory.

```ps
$ ayo i @username/repo @username/repo[branch] dir-name
```

## Creating Your Script

To create your script, try:

```ps
$ ayo new
```

Two files will be generated: `ayo.config.json` and `ayo-script.py`. Currently, `ayo` itself provides two built-in utilities:

- Template: Used to create an app from a template folder or do it manually
- Steps: Represents steps for your application, and caches previous data even when canceled.

First, let's take a look at `ayo.config.json`. This configuration JSON file determines which file(s) `ayo` needs to run. Below is the default content that was generated using the `new` command:

```json
{
    "bin": "ayo-script.py",
    "with": [],
    "before-scripts": []
}
```

- `bin`: The file that runs the script. Think of it as `main.py`
- `with`: The files to also contain when downloading this from GitHub. Usually used when the `bin` file requires modules. This field should only contain `.py` files. Optional.
- `before-scripts`: Scripts to run before running the `bin` file. Optional.

Then, take a look at `ayo-script.py`. You should see the default script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from ayo import Template, true_or_false

yn = input("Can I install something for you?")
if not true_or_false(yn):
    exit(1)

Template({
    "main.py": "# surprise! new app!"
}).install()
```

Decent code! But let's twist it a little bit: let's edit it so we can try out the `Steps` and `Template` feature!

It goes something like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

from ayo import Steps

steps = Steps()

@steps.first # first step
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

@steps.then # then...
def ask_for_install(data):
    # 'data': data returned from the previous function
    # in this case, None!
    return input("Can I install something for you?")

@steps.then
def write_or_exit(data: str):
    # the 'data' is given from the 'input()'
    if data.lower() != "yes":
        exit(1)

    Template({
        "main.py": "# surprise! new app!",
        "another-dir": {
            "README.md": "More content!"
        }
    }).install("new-app")

steps.start() # start!
```

With `Steps`, whenever the user sneakly (or maybe they just want to go out for a bit) pressed `^C` which causes `KeyboardInterrupt`, the program writes a new file (`_ayo$cache.py`) for cache-storing so that the next time they can quickly pick up from where they left off and continue their journey!

Let's try out our freshly made script by running:

```ps
$ ayo run
```

## Available Commands

To check the available commands, run:

```ps
$ ayo --help
```

## Reference

### Template

Represents an ayo script template.

Args:

- contents (`str` | dict[str, Any]): The contents. Could be a `str` representing the directory to use as a template or a directory dictionary.

To use `contents` as `str`, you'll need a directory called `.ayo-templates`. You can define templates here. See the below file tree example:

```
.ayo-templates/
├─ template-a/
│  ├─ ... files & dirs
│
├─ template-b/
│  ├─ ... files & dirs
│
├─ .../
```

To use the templates, simply use:

```python
from ayo import Template

Template("template-a").install("app-directory")
Template("template-b").install("app-directory")
```

In some occasions, you might want to ignore some files or directories from the template. To do so, pass in the `ignores` parameter:

```python
Template("template-a").install(
    "app-directory",
    ignores={
        "unwanted-dir": ..., # use '...' here
        ".gitignore": ...,
        "venv": {
            "bin": ...
        }
    }
)
```

As the name implies, "directory dictionaries" are just plain old Python dictionaries that work like file trees. `ayo` supports them!

```python
from ayo import Template

Template({
    "main.py": "# very normal main.py",
    "venv": {
        "bin": {
            "README.md": "hahaha! this is the file content!"
        }
    }
}).install("app-directory")
```

Same as the above, you can ignore specific files and directories:

```python
Template({
    "main.py": "# very normal main.py",
    # ... existing code
}).install("app-directory", {
    "main.py": ..., # use '...' here
    ".gitignore": ...,

    "folders": {
        "work": {
            "too.txt": "WOW!"
        }
    }
})
```

### Steps

Represents steps.

Args:

- cache (`bool`, optional): Whether to cache (remember) data as completions or not, so that even if `KeyboardInterrupt` occurs, the next time when this script executes, we can get the previous data, and skip directly to the last step the user is on.

I personally don't like reading, but code is what I skip to.

Here's an example of the `Steps` class:

```python
from ayo import Steps

steps = Steps()

@steps.first # first step
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

@steps.then # then...
def ask_for_install(data):
    # 'data': data returned from the previous function
    # in this case, None!
    return input("Can I install something for you?")

@steps.then
def write_or_exit(data: str):
    # the 'data' is given from the 'input()'
    if data.lower() != "yes":
        exit(1)

    Template({
        "main.py": "# surprise! new app!",
        "another-dir": {
            "README.md": "More content!"
        }
    }).install("new-app")

steps.start() # start!
```

Now, whenever the user tries to `^C` or exit the program, `ayo` remembers everything... NO CRIMES ALLOWED!

If you're wondering how to remove the cache, simply run:

```ps
$ ayo clean-cache
```

### true\_or\_false (tof)

Checks whether the input provided by the user (Yn) is true or not.

This is useful for "parsing" (more like understanding) `Yn` user inputs.

Args:

- \_input (`str`): The input.
- false_if_unknown (`bool`, optional): Whether to return `False` if received unrecognized input or not.

```python
from ayo import tof # sneaky shortcut

a = "yes"
print(tof(a)) # -> True

b = "nope"
print(tof(b)) # -> False

c = "you'll never guess what i mean!!"

print(tof(c)) # -> False
print(tof(c, false_if_unknown=False)) # Error
```
