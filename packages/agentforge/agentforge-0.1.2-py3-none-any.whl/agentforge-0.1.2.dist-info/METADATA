## Installation
To install AgentForge, follow these steps:

Set your environment variables:

Claude: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
OpenAI: OPENAI_API_KEY
Google: GOOGLE_API_KEY


Install AgentForge:

```shell
pip install agentforge
```

Navigate to where you want your bot's project folder:

```shell
cd c:\bot\folder
```

Run the initialization script:

```shell
agentforge init
```

Additionally, if you just want to try our demo agent, run the following command to copy our bot script to your project folder:

```shell
agentforge salience
```

## Devbuild installation

If you want to install the build from the dev branch and help with development, follow these instructions instead:

Clone the GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DataBassGit/AgentForge.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Navigate to `/tests/examples/.agentforge`, and use the .env.example to create a .env file that contains your api keys.


## Usage

Modify the agent prompts in `/tests/examples/.agentforgedefault.json`. At the top of the file you will edit the name, objective, and tasks.
This should be enough to start.

Navigate to `/tests/examples/` in your console and run

```shell
python salience_old.py
```

You will be asked if you would like to run in manual mode or auto mode. Choose manual mode for now.
Before each round of execution, you will be asked to continue.
The agent will automatically provide feedback after each execution.
This will add the feedback to the execution prompt.
You can also type whatever feedback you would like to provide to the bot manually.
