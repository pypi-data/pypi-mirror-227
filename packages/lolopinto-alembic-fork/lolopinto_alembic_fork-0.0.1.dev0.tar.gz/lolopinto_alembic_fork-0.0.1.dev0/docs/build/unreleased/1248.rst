    :tags: usecase, autogenerate

    Change the default value of
    :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.configure.compare_type` to ``True``.
    As Alembic's autogenerate for types was dramatically improved in
    version 1.4 released in 2020, the type comparison feature is now much
    more reliable so is now enabled by default.
