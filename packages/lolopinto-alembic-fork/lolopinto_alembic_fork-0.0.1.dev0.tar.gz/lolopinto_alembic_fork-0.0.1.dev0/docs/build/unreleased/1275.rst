    :tickets: 1275

    Added new feature to the "code formatter" function which allows standalone
    executable tools to be run against code, without going through the Python
    interpreter.  Known as the ``exec`` runner, it complements the existing
    ``console_scripts`` runner by allowing non-Python tools such as ``ruff`` to
    be used.   Pull request courtesy Mihail Milushev.
