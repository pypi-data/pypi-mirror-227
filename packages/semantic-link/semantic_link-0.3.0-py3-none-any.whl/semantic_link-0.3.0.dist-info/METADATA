Semantic Link is a feature that allows you to establish a connection between Power BI datasets and Synapse Data Science in Microsoft Fabric.  

The primary goals of Semantic Link are to facilitate data connectivity, enable the propagation of semantic information, and seamlessly integrate with established tools used by data scientists, such as notebooks.  

Semantic Link helps you to preserve domain knowledge about data semantics in a standardized way that can speed up data analysis and reduce errors.
