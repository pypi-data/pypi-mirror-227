1. change folder strcture: src/package_name
2. add __init__.py 
3. move all folders inside src/package_name (add __init__.py for each folder so we can import in main)
4. add ref_test.py in each folder to test the wrapper reference
5. add wrapper function in main.py at root folder.
6. add __all__ = ["script_name"] in init.py


there is no internal reference right?
what is the functions we want to expose to outside?
readme file need to be updated base on instruction to clnt

I need to run it on my local
I need to include all libs required to run in the toml file
include files and exclude files
I need to work with main contributor more closely on the file selection
current folder structure are brute force, if can run over the code with me so we can make it concise
