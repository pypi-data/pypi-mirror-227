## Spear-TTS - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03540">Spear-TTS</a> - multi-speaker text-to-speech attention network, in Pytorch

The text-to-semantic module built here will be used for <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/soundstorm-pytorch">SoundStorm</a> for conditioning.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for their generous sponsorships to work on and open source cutting edge artificial intelligence research

- <a href="https://github.com/lucasnewman">Lucas Newman</a> for completing the <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/spear-tts-pytorch/pull/4">backtranslation</a> portion, as well as beam search decoding!

- <a href="https://github.com/lucasnewman">Lucas Newman</a> for completing the final text to semantic transformer training code!

## Todo

- [x] add eos logic + generate, and hook up end-to-end generation in soundstorm
- [x] add first pretraining speech-to-speech with the reconstruction of 60% deleted tokens
- [x] add dropouts for this project, as low-resource
- [x] add total flexiblity of which layers of encoder / decoder to freeze during training
- [x] add step for training on small speech -> text corpus and generating pseudo-labelled dataset + finetuning (thanks to @lucasnewman)
- [x] add final step of finetuning on text -> speech + pseudolabelled dataset

- [ ] figure out the best way to store and manage the pseudo-labelled generated dataset
- [ ] see if one can speed up text-to-semantic transformer with NAR (perhaps maskgit style, or some AR / NAR hybrid)
