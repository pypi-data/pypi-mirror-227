# Data Checks
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg) 

**Create, schedule, and deploy data quality checks.**

## Overview
Exisiting data observability solutions are painfully static. **data_checks** provides a dynamic data observability framework that allows you to reuse existing Python code and/or write new Python code to define data quality checks that can then be easily scheduled and monitored. Inspired by Python's [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), data_checks allows you to write data quality checks as easily and seamlessly as you would write unittests on your code.


## Getting Started
### Installation
Install the latest version of data_checks using pip:
```bash
pip install pydata-checks
```



See the [documentation](https://github.com/SuperiorityComplex/data_checks/wiki) for more information.
