# mvsma

mvsma, aka *mhamster's very simple modrinth api (wrapper)*, is a super simple modrinth api wrapper for python.

Package provides plain and simple access to [modrinth's api](https://api.modrinth.com) endpoints and returns json responses. Very easy to use!

For information about api models see [modrinth api documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/api-spec/#tag/project_model).

### But why?

--- 
Because why would you want to mess with api yourself, when some random guy from internet (like me) can do it for you?
