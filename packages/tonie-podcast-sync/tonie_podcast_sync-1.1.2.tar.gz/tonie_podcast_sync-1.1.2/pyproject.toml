#  -- had to uncomment the tonie-api dependency unforunately. 
#     reason is that pypi does not accept direct dependencies
#     to other git projects, so this will fail during 'poetry publish'.
#     see e.g. https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4471
#     Workaround is currently to have tonie_api included as a submodule
