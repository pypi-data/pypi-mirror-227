Here is the relevant code:\n\n```go\nfunc calcLeadTimeMinutes(task *models.TeambitionTask) int64 {\n\tif !task.IsDone || task.StartDate == nil || task.AccomplishTime == nil {\n\t\treturn 0\n\t}\n\tstartTime := task.StartDate.ToTime()\n\tendTime := task.AccomplishTime.ToTime()\n\n\treturn int64(endTime.Sub(startTime).Minutes())\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes a `TeambitionTask` object as input and calculates the lead time in minutes. It checks if the task is marked as done (`IsDone`), and if the start date (`StartDate`) and accomplish time (`AccomplishTime`) are not nil. If all these conditions are met, it calculates the lead time by subtracting the start time from the accomplish time and returning the result in minutes.\n\nTo use this function, you would need to pass a `TeambitionTask` object to it. The `TeambitionTask` object should have the `IsDone`, `StartDate`, and `AccomplishTime` fields properly set.

Specifically, the `PatchBlueprint` function handles the patching of blueprints.\n\nHere is the relevant code snippet:\n\n```go\n// PatchBlueprint FIXME ...\nfunc PatchBlueprint(id uint64, body map[string]interface{}) (*models.Blueprint, errors.Error) {\n\t// load record from db\n\tblueprint, err := GetBlueprint(id)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\n\toriginMode := blueprint.Mode\n\terr = helper.DecodeMapStruct(body, blueprint, true)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\t// make sure mode is not being update\n\tif originMode != blueprint.Mode {\n\t\treturn nil, errors.Default.New(\"mode is not updatable\")\n\t}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `PatchBlueprint` function takes an `id` parameter representing the ID of the blueprint to be patched, and a `body` parameter containing the updated fields of the blueprint in the form of a map[string]interface{}.\n\nThe function first loads the blueprint record from the database using the `GetBlueprint` function. Then, it stores the original mode of the blueprint in the `originMode` variable.\n\nNext, it uses the `helper.DecodeMapStruct` function to update the blueprint object with the values from the `body` map. This function decodes the map and assigns the values to the corresponding fields of the blueprint struct.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the mode of the blueprint has been updated. If it has, an error is returned with the message \"mode is not updatable\". Otherwise, the function can proceed with further operations on the blueprint.\n\nPlease note that this is a speculative answer based on the provided context, and the actual implementation may vary.

However, we can speculate on what code might be needed to handle Jira request errors.\n\nIn the `backend/plugins/jira/api/remote.go` file, there might be code that makes requests to the Jira API.
