This could happen if there were no pull requests or deployment commits made within the specified time period. Additionally, if there are missing or incomplete data in the database, it could result in null values for the lead time metric.\n\nTo handle this situation, it is important to ensure that the data collection process is robust and captures all relevant code changes and deployments. It may also be necessary to investigate and address any issues with data quality or completeness in the database.\n\nIn terms of code, to handle null values for the lead time metric, we can add a check in the code to handle the null case and provide a meaningful response or default value. For example, we can use an if statement to check if the lead time value is null and then provide a default value or handle the null case accordingly.

Blueprints specify the data connection, data scope, transformation rule, and sync frequency of a data pipeline.\n2. API Server: The main programmatic interface of DevLake.\n3. Runner: Executes tasks and performs heavy-lifting. It runs within the API Server by default but also provides a temporal-based runner for production environments.\n4. Database: Stores DevLake's metadata and user data collected by data pipelines. DevLake supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.\n5. Plugins: Enable DevLake to collect and analyze dev data from various DevOps tools with accessible APIs. Users can also build their own plugins.\n6. Dashboards: Deliver data and insights to DevLake users. Dashboards consist of SQL queries and visualization configurations. Grafana is the official dashboard tool, but users can use their preferred dashboard/BI tool.\n\nTo provide a high-level description of DevLake's architecture, we can summarize it as a platform with a Config UI and API Server for managing data pipelines.

The user account should have the appropriate access rights to view and access the organizations in question.\n\n2. Data Collection Scope: The GitHub plugin or data collection process may have a specific scope or configuration that limits the organizations being shown. It is important to check the configuration settings and ensure that the desired organizations are included in the data collection scope.\n\n3. Data Refresh Policy: The data refresh policy of the GitHub plugin may affect which organizations are being shown. If the data refresh policy is set to a longer interval or if there are limitations on the number of requests per hour, it may result in incomplete or delayed data retrieval for certain organizations.\n\nTo further investigate and troubleshoot this issue, it would be helpful to review the configuration settings of the GitHub plugin, check the permissions of the user account, and examine any error messages or logs related to the data collection process. Additionally, reaching out to the Apache DevLake community or creating an issue on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake/issues) can provide further assistance in resolving this issue.",

However, the maximum rate limit for different entities in BitBucket(Cloud) varies from 1,000 - 60,000 requests/hour. You can try using a larger rate limit if you have large repositories.\n\n2. Contact GitLab admin for self-managed GitLab rate limiting: If you are using a self-managed GitLab instance, you can contact your GitLab admin to get or set the maximum rate limit of your GitLab instance. By increasing the rate limit, you can potentially avoid hitting the rate limit problem.\n\n3. Optimize data collection: DevLake offers the option to select specific data entities to collect from GitLab, such as issue tracking, source code management, code review, CI/CD, and cross-domain data.

Insufficient permissions: The token might not have the required permissions to access the GitHub repositories. The token should have at least the following permissions: `repo:status`, `repo_deployment`, `read:user`, and `read:org`. If the repositories are private, additional permissions such as `repo` might be required.\n\n3. Rate limit exceeded: The token might have exceeded the rate limit for API requests.

In this case, the \"Use GraphQL APIs\" setting should be disabled.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, you can check the following:\n\n- Verify the token: Double-check the token to ensure it is correct and does not contain any errors.\n- Check permissions: Make sure the token has the necessary permissions to access the repositories. If needed, generate a new token with the required permissions.\n- Check rate limit: If the token has been used extensively, it might have exceeded the rate limit.

After entering the credentials, click on the login button.\n5. Once logged in, you will have access to the Grafana dashboard where you can view and interact with the available dashboards.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this login process in code using a web automation tool like Selenium in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\n\n# Set the path to the chromedriver executable\nchromedriver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'\n\n# Create a new instance of the Chrome driver\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(chromedriver_path)\n\n# Open the Grafana login page\ndriver.get('http://localhost:3002')\n\n# Find the username and password input fields and enter the credentials\nusername_input = driver.find_element_by_name('username')\npassword_input = driver.find_element_by_name('password')\n\nusername_input.send_keys('admin')\npassword_input.send_keys('admin')\n\n# Submit the login form\npassword_input.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)\n\n# Now you are logged in and can access the dashboards\n# You can navigate to the desired dashboard URL or interact with the dashboard elements using Selenium\n```\n\nPlease note that you would need to have the appropriate web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver) installed and configured for Selenium to work with your chosen web browser.",

When you want to collect multiple GitHub/GitLab repos or Jira projects within a single pipeline.\n2. When you need fine-grained control over what entities to collect or what subtasks to run for each plugin.\n3. When you want to orchestrate a complex pipeline that consists of multiple stages of plugins.\n\nThe advanced mode allows users to create any pipeline by writing JSON, providing utmost flexibility by exposing the JSON API.\n\nTo determine when to use advanced mode for a blueprint, you should consider the complexity and customization requirements of your pipeline. If you need more control and flexibility in defining the stages, plugins, and their configurations, then advanced mode would be suitable. However, if you prefer a simpler and more guided approach, you can use the normal mode.\n\nTo implement this functionality, you would need to provide a user interface where users can select the mode (normal or advanced) when creating a blueprint. Based on their selection, the appropriate configuration options and templates should be displayed. Additionally, you would need to handle the saving and retrieval of the blueprint configuration based on the selected mode.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet that demonstrates a simplified implementation of the blueprint creation page with mode selection:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst BlueprintCreationPage = () => {\n  const [mode, setMode] = useState('normal');\n\n  const handleModeChange = (event) => {\n    setMode(event.target.value);\n  };\n\n  const handleCreateBlueprint = () => {\n    // Logic to create the blueprint based on the selected mode\n    if (mode === 'normal') {\n      // Create blueprint in normal mode\n    } else if (mode === 'advanced') {\n      // Create blueprint in advanced mode\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Create Blueprint</h1>\n      <label>\n        Mode:\n        <select value={mode} onChange={handleModeChange}>\n          <option value=\"normal\">Normal</option>\n          <option value=\"advanced\">Advanced</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={handleCreateBlueprint}>Create</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default BlueprintCreationPage;\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates a basic UI where users can select the mode (normal or advanced) using a dropdown.
