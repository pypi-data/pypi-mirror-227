However, we can speculate on the possible code that might be involved in the blueprint edit process.\n\n1. In the `backend/server/api/blueprints/blueprints.go` file, the `Patch` function handles the PATCH request for updating a blueprint. It receives the `blueprintId` from the request path and the update data in the request body.\n\n2. The `Patch` function calls the `services.PatchBlueprint` function in the `backend/server/services/blueprint.go` file to perform the actual update.\n\n3. In the `services.PatchBlueprint` function, it loads the existing blueprint record from the database using the `GetBlueprint` function.\n\n4. It then decodes the update data from the request body and updates the corresponding fields in the blueprint struct.\n\n5. After updating the blueprint, it checks if the `Mode` field has been modified. If it has been modified, it returns an error since the `Mode` field is not updatable.\n\n6. If the `Mode` field has not been modified, it validates the updated blueprint and generates a new plan for the blueprint using the `validateBlueprintAndMakePlan` function.\n\n7. If the validation and plan generation are successful, it saves the updated blueprint to the database using the `SaveDbBlueprint` function.\n\n8. Finally, it reloads the blueprints schedule using the `ReloadBlueprints` function.\n\nBased on this speculation, the code for blueprint edit might involve the following steps:\n\n1.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide the relevant golang code verbatim for the Jira request error handler.\n\nTo handle Jira request errors in general, you would typically need to make use of the Jira API client library or write custom code to handle the HTTP requests and responses. The specific error handling code would depend on the library or implementation being used.\n\nHere is a speculative example of how error handling for a Jira request could be implemented using the `go-jira` library:\n\n```go\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Create a new Jira client\n    jiraClient, err := jira.NewClient(nil, \"https://your-jira-instance.com\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(\"Failed to create Jira client:\", err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Perform a Jira request\n    issue, _, err := jiraClient.Issue.Get(\"PROJECT-123\", nil)\n    if err != nil {\n        // Handle the Jira request error\n        if jiraErr, ok := err.(*jira.ErrorResponse); ok {\n            // Jira API returned an error response\n            fmt.Println(\"Jira API error:\", jiraErr.Message)\n            for _, apiError := range jiraErr.Errors {\n                fmt.Println(\"Error details:\", apiError)\n            }\n        } else {\n            // Other error occurred\n            fmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n        }\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Process the Jira issue\n    fmt.Println(\"Issue:\", issue.Key)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `jira.NewClient` function is used to create a new Jira client. Then, the `jiraClient.Issue.Get` method is called to retrieve a specific issue. If an error occurs during the Jira request, the error is checked to see if it is an `*jira.ErrorResponse`. If it is, the error response message and details are printed. Otherwise, the error is treated as a generic error.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes the usage of the `go-jira` library, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific library or code being used.", "evaluator": "Rating", "value": 2, "reason": "The text provided a detailed explanation and example of how to handle Jira request errors using the `go-jira` library in Golang.

However, we can speculate on what code might be needed to perform a blueprint upgrade.\n\nTo perform a blueprint upgrade, we would need to make a PATCH request to the `/blueprints/:blueprintId` endpoint with the updated blueprint details.
