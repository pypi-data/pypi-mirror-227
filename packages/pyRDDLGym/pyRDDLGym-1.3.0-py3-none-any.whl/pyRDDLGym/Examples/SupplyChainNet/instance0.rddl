// A modification of a typical supply chain control problem with a factory
// and multiple warehouses. Here, there is a transportation cost of deliver-
// ing goods between factory and warehouses, such that the allocation problem
// can be seen as an embedded travelling salesman problem (TSP) of finding
// the cheapest transporation route. Meanwhile, actions are continuous and
// indicate the proportion of goods that must be shipped out of each factory
// or warehouse to meet demand, modeled here as Poisson random variables, and
// how many units to produce as a fraction of maximum production capacity.
