-------------------------- 
This folder contains 3 subfolder with different SAWYT simulation runs:

Run 1: Observed Phenology 
Simulation using observed days to heading and observed days to maturity as inputs.

Run 2: All estimated 
Simulation using estimated days to heading and days to maturity as inputs.

Run 3: Mixed Phenology
Simulation using observed days to heading and estimated days to maturity
