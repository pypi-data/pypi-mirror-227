**mosaicMPI** is a Python package enabling mosaic integration of bulk, single-cell, and spatial expression data through program-level integration.
Programs are first discovered using consensus non-negative matrix factorization and then integrated using a flexible network-based approach to group
similar programs together across resolutions and datasets. Program communities are then interpreted using sample/cell metadata and classical gene
set analyses. Integrative program communities enable metadata transfer across datasets.


## ‚ö°Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that mosaicMPI does well:

- Identifies interpretable, non-negative programs at multiple resolutions
- Mosaic integration does not require subsetting features/genes to
  a shared or overdispersed subset
- Multi-omics integration does not require shared sample IDs
- Ideal for incremental integration (adding datasets one at a time) since
  deconvolution is performed independently on each dataset
- Integration performs well even when the datasets have mismatched features
  (eg. Microarray, RNA-Seq, Proteomics) or sparsity (eg single-cell vs bulk RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq)
- Metadata transfer across datasets
- Command-line interface for rapid data exploration and python
  interface for extensibility and flexibility

## üîß Install

### üß∞ System Requirements

- Compatible with and tested on OS X, Windows and Linux systems
- Memory usage depends on size and number of datasets

### ‚ú® Latest Release
 an isolated conda environment):
```bash
Install the package with conda (in
conda create -n mosaicmpi -c conda-forge mosaicmpi
conda activate mosaicmpi
```

## üìñ Documentation

### üóê Data guidelines

mosaicMPI can factorize a wide variety of datasets, but will work optimally in these conditions:
  - Use untransformed, raw data data where possible, and avoid log-transformed data
  - For single-cell, spatial, or bulk RNA-Seq data, the best data to use is feature counts, then TPM-normalized values, then RPKM/FPKM-normalized values.

### üìì Python interface

To get started, download the [sample datasets](/tutorial/cptac_data) and [Jupyter notebook tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial_1.ipynb).

Detailed API reference can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://mosaicmpi.readthedocs.io/).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command line interface

Program discovery and integration can also be conducted on the command line using the command line interface (CLI), for common workflows.

See the [command line interface documentation](/CLI.md).
