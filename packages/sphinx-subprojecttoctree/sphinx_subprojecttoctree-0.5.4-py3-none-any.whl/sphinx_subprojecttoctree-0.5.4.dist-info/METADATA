# Subprojecttoctree
Subprojecttoctrees is a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) extension that aims
to facilitate the integration of several documentation sources into a single 
[Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io) webpage. This project extends the 
[Read the Docs subproject](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/subprojects.html) 
concept, which allows projects to be configured as a subproject of another project, 
by creating a unified sidebar of URLs between these projects. A single 'master' index
is specified in the 'main' project, eliminating the need to update all subprojects 
to change the index and allowing for version-specific sidebar links.
