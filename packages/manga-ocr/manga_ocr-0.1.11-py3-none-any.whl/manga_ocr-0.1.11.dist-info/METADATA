# Manga OCR

Optical character recognition for Japanese text, with the main focus being Japanese manga.
It uses a custom end-to-end model built with Transformers' [Vision Encoder Decoder](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vision-encoder-decoder) framework. 

Manga OCR can be used as a general purpose printed Japanese OCR, but its main goal was to provide a high quality
text recognition, robust against various scenarios specific to manga:
- both vertical and horizontal text
- text with furigana
- text overlaid on images
- wide variety of fonts and font styles
- low quality images

Unlike many OCR models, Manga OCR supports recognizing multi-line text in a single forward pass,
so that text bubbles found in manga can be processed at once, without splitting them into lines.
