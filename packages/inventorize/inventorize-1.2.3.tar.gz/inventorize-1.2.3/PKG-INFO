Description: Simulate inventory policies, facilitate inventory analysis calculations such as  stock levels and re-order points,pricing and promotions calculations. 
  The package includes calculations of inventory metrics, stock-out calculations and ABC analysis calculations.
    The package includes revenue management techniques such as Multi-product optimization,logit model optimization.

Change Log
==========

1.2.3 (26/08/2023)
Some bug fixes

1.2.1 (23/08/2023)
-------------------
- second   Release
1- R.s.S inventory policy is added.
2- Max policy is added (different than Min Max)
2- you can compare forecasting impact on inventory not just relying on the average.
3- the forecasts can be one step like exponential smoothing/croston or multi-steps like machine learning models or seasonal arimas.
4- the plots are automatically added with a TRUE or FALSE arguments.
5- polynomial price optimization is added with the current linear and logit.
6- the markdown model for seasonal merchandizing from (walker 1999) is added to identify the viability and the percentage of the markdown.
7- In static policies, you can can recalculate the min and the max during the simulation horizon. Also user can manually define the min, max, quantity, saftey stock if required.

8- the classification of the demand is added as an output.
9- average flow time is added which is how much time on average a unit stays in stock.
10- initial inventory level can be set manually.
11- also because many have asked the ABC thresholds can be changed and up to two attributes can be added in the function abc_dynamic().
12- negative binomial and gamme distributions are added
13- comparing distributions of demand.



0.0.8 (29/08/2020)
