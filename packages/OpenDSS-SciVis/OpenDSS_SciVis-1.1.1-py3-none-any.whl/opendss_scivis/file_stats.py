'''
This function compares the csv files in a pair of directories. It first gets the model directory and 
checks to see if the files in the model directory exist in the reference directory. It the checks if 
any column statistic has a fail and if it does it will mark all_success as 'Fail'

Input:
mod_dir: the model directory the user wants to test
ref_dir: reference directory against which the user wants to compare

Keywords:
exclude: a list of file names to be excluded from comparison as specified by substrings,
         e.g., exclude=['Summary','YPRIM'] to ignore any files containing these substrings in the
         filenames

Output:
file_dict: a dictionary with the key being the file name and the value being the statistic
all_success: the value that checks to see whether the test has passed or failed
