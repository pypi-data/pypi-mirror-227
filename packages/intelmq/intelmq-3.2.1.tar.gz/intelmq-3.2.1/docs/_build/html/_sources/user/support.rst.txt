General tips
************

To be most efficient in seeking help, please describe your problem or question with all necessary information, for example:
 * Name and version of the operating system
 * Way of installation (deb/rpm packages, PyPI, local git repository)
 * Used bots and configuration
 * Logs of bots or terminal output
 * Any other useful messages, screenshots

Mailing list
************

The most traditional way is to ask your question, make a proposal or discuss a topic on the |intelmq-users-list-link|.
You need to subscribe to the mailing list before posting, but the archive is publicly available: `IntelMQ-Users Archive <https://lists.cert.at/pipermail/intelmq-users/>`_.

GitHub
******

To report bugs, `GitHub issues <https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/issues>`_ are the ideal place to do so.
Every IntelMQ component has it's own repository on GitHub, with a separate Issue tracker.

GitHub also offers a `discussion platform <https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/discussions>`_.

To participate on GitHub, you first need to create an account on the platform.
