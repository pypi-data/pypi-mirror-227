class ReservoirReplayBuffer(nn.Cell):
    """
    ReservoirReplayBufferCreate is experience container used in reinforcement learning.
    The algorithm is proposed in `Random sampling with a reservoir <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3147.3165>`
    which used in `Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164>`.
    It lets the reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experiences from the past. Besides, It keeps an
    'unbiased' sample of previous iterations.

    Args:
        capcity (int64): Capacity of the buffer.
        shapes (list[tuple[int]]): The dimensionality of the transition.
        dtypes (list[:class:`mindspore.dtype`]): The type of the transition.
        seed0 (int): Random seed0, must be non-negative. Default: ``0``.
        seed1 (int): Random seed1, must be non-negative. Default: ``0``.

    Outputs:
        handle(Tensor): Handle of created replay buffer instance with dtype int64 and shape :math:`(1,)`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: The args not provided.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> from mindspore_rl.core.reservoir_replay_buffer import ReservoirReplayBuffer
        >>> capacity = 10000
        >>> batch_size = 10
        >>> shapes = [(4,), (1,), (1,), (4,)]
        >>> dtypes = [ms.float32, ms.int32, ms.float32, ms.float32]
        >>> replaybuffer = ReservoirReplayBuffer(alpha, capacity, batch_size, shapes, dtypes)
