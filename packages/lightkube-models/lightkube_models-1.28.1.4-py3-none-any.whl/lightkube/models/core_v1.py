      * **envFrom** ``List[EnvFromSource]`` - *(optional)* List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be
        reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in
        multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take
        precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take
        precedence. Cannot be updated.
      * **image** ``str`` - *(optional)* Container image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional
        to allow higher level config management to default or override container
        images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.

        :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More
        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
      * **lifecycle** ``Lifecycle`` - *(optional)* Actions that the management system should take in response to container
        lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.
      * **livenessProbe** ``Probe`` - *(optional)* Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe
        fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **ports** ``List[ContainerPort]`` - *(optional)* List of ports to expose from the container. Not specifying a port here DOES
        NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
        default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the

        For more information See

      * **readinessProbe** ``Probe`` - *(optional)* Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from
        service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **resizePolicy** ``List[ContainerResizePolicy]`` - *(optional)* Resources resize policy for the container.
      * **resources** ``ResourceRequirements`` - *(optional)* Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/
      * **restartPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is
        "Always". For non-init containers or when this field is not specified, the
        restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container
        type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have
        the following effect: this init container will be continually restarted on
        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers
        have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always" will be shut
        down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred
        to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init container still starts in the
        init container sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init container starts
        immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe
        has successfully completed.
      * **securityContext** ``SecurityContext`` - *(optional)* SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with.
        If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of
        PodSecurityContext. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
      * **startupProbe** ``Probe`` - *(optional)* StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If
        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If
        this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe
        failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the
        beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or
        warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
      * **stdin** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always
        result in EOF. Default is false.
      * **stdinOnce** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been
        opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is
        opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin,
        and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which
        time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If
        this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never
        receive an EOF. Default is false
      * **terminationMessagePath** ``str`` - *(optional)* Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
        will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is
        intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will
        be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length
        across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
      * **terminationMessagePolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
        contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on
        both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of
        container log output if the termination message file is empty and the
        container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
      * **tty** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin'
        to be true. Default is false.
      * **volumeDevices** ``List[VolumeDevice]`` - *(optional)* volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
      * **volumeMounts** ``List[VolumeMount]`` - *(optional)* Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.
      * **workingDir** ``str`` - *(optional)* Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot
        be updated.

        The container runtime must implement support for this feature. If the runtime
        does not support namespace targeting then the result of setting this field is
        undefined.
      * **terminationMessagePath** ``str`` - *(optional)* Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message
        will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is
        intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will
        be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length
        across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
      * **terminationMessagePolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the
        contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on
        both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of
        container log output if the termination message file is empty and the
        container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
      * **tty** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin'
        to be true. Default is false.
      * **volumeDevices** ``List[VolumeDevice]`` - *(optional)* volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
      * **volumeMounts** ``List[VolumeMount]`` - *(optional)* Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Subpath mounts are not
        allowed for ephemeral containers. Cannot be updated.
      * **workingDir** ``str`` - *(optional)* Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot
        be updated.

        payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The

        payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the

        errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a
        rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to
        resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can
        find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in
        the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the error state;

        Assigned config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a
        10-minute soak period starting when the local record of Assigned config is
        updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it
        becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use
        local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because
        the local default config is always assumed good. You should not make

        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects

        	- pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] =
        "ControllerResizeInProgress"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] =
        "ControllerResizeFailed"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizePending"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
             - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
        When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress
        for the given PVC.
        A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or
        ClaimResourceStatus should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed.
        For example - a controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of
        the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources
        associated with PVC.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure
        feature.
      * **allocatedResources** ``dict`` - *(optional)* allocatedResources tracks the resources allocated to a PVC including its
        capacity. Key names follow standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are
        either:
        	* Un-prefixed keys:
        		- storage - the capacity of the volume.
        	* Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as
        "example.com/my-custom-resource"
        Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io
        prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.
        Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume
        expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from
        allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is
        not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume
        expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if
        there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume
        capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity.
        A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
        should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a
        controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume,

        "Always" is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
      * **runAsGroup** ``int`` - *(optional)* The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default

        SecurityContext takes precedence.
      * **runAsUser** ``int`` - *(optional)* The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in

      * **affinity** ``Affinity`` - *(optional)* If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints
      * **automountServiceAccountToken** ``bool`` - *(optional)* AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token should
        be automatically mounted.
      * **dnsConfig** ``PodDNSConfig`` - *(optional)* Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
        merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.
      * **dnsPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
        'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS parameters
        given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with DNSPolicy. To
        have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to specify DNS policy
        explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
      * **enableServiceLinks** ``bool`` - *(optional)* EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be
        injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker
        links. Optional: Defaults to true.
      * **ephemeralContainers** ``List[EphemeralContainer]`` - *(optional)* List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be run
        in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging. This
        list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by
        updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an existing
        pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource.
      * **hostAliases** ``List[HostAlias]`` - *(optional)* HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into
        the pod's hosts file if specified. This is only valid for non-hostNetwork
        pods.

      * **hostNetwork** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace. If
        this option is set, the ports that will be used must be specified. Default to
        false.
      * **hostPID** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.
      * **hostUsers** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Use the host's user namespace. Optional: Default to true. If set to true or
        not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful for when
        the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
        loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE. When set to false, a new userns
        is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for mitigating container
        breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their containers as root
        without actually having root privileges on the host. This field is alpha-level
        and is only honored by servers that enable the UserNamespacesSupport feature.
      * **hostname** ``str`` - *(optional)* Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will be
        set to a system-defined value.
      * **imagePullSecrets** ``List[LocalObjectReference]`` - *(optional)* ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same
        namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If

        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
      * **initContainers** ``List[Container]`` - *(optional)* List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are
        executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container
        fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its
        restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
        unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions,
        Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements
        of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the
        highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of
        that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init
        containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or
        removed. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
      * **nodeName** ``str`` - *(optional)* NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is
        non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming
        that it fits resource requirements.
      * **nodeSelector** ``dict`` - *(optional)* NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node.
        Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that
        node. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
      * **os** ``PodOS`` - *(optional)* Specifies the OS of the containers in the pod. Some pod and container fields
        are restricted if this is set.
        If the OS field is set to linux, the following fields must be unset:
        -securityContext.windowsOptions

      * **overhead** ``dict`` - *(optional)* Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a
        given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the
        RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is
        enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass
        admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead
        already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec,
        Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass,
        otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md
      * **preemptionPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower priority. One of
        Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if unset.
      * **priority** ``int`` - *(optional)* The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
        priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it
        prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates
        this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the
        priority.
      * **priorityClassName** ``str`` - *(optional)* If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and
        "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest
        priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be
        defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified,
        the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
      * **readinessGates** ``List[PodReadinessGate]`` - *(optional)* If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod
        is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the
        readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates
      * **resourceClaims** ``List[PodResourceClaim]`` - *(optional)* ResourceClaims defines which ResourceClaims must be allocated and reserved
        before the Pod is allowed to start. The resources will be made available to
        those containers which consume them by name.
        This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation
        feature gate.
        This field is immutable.
      * **restartPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure,
        Never. In some contexts, only a subset of those values may be permitted.
        Default to Always. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
      * **runtimeClassName** ``str`` - *(optional)* RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group,
        which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the
        named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy"
        RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition
        that uses the default runtime handler. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class
      * **schedulerName** ``str`` - *(optional)* If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
        specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
      * **schedulingGates** ``List[PodSchedulingGate]`` - *(optional)* SchedulingGates is an opaque list of values that if specified will block
        scheduling the pod. If schedulingGates is not empty, the pod will stay in the
        SchedulingGated state and the scheduler will not attempt to schedule the pod.
        SchedulingGates can only be set at pod creation time, and be removed only
        afterwards.
        This is a beta feature enabled by the PodSchedulingReadiness feature gate.
      * **securityContext** ``PodSecurityContext`` - *(optional)* SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container
        settings. Optional: Defaults to empty.  See type description for default
        values of each field.
      * **serviceAccount** ``str`` - *(optional)* DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName.
        Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
      * **serviceAccountName** ``str`` - *(optional)* ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this pod.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
      * **setHostnameAsFQDN** ``bool`` - *(optional)* If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than
        the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN
        in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In
        Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the
        registry key
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters to FQDN.
        If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
      * **shareProcessNamespace** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When
        this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other
        containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not
        be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set.
        Optional: Default to false.
      * **subdomain** ``str`` - *(optional)* If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
        "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not
        specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
      * **terminationGracePeriodSeconds** ``int`` - *(optional)* Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be
        decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
        zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut
        down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead.
        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the
        pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly
        halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup
        time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
      * **tolerations** ``List[Toleration]`` - *(optional)* If specified, the pod's tolerations.
      * **topologySpreadConstraints** ``List[TopologySpreadConstraint]`` - *(optional)* TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across
        topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the
        constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.
      * **volumes** ``List[Volume]`` - *(optional)* List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More

      * **containerStatuses** ``List[ContainerStatus]`` - *(optional)* The list has one entry per container in the manifest. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status
      * **ephemeralContainerStatuses** ``List[ContainerStatus]`` - *(optional)* Status for any ephemeral containers that have run in this pod.
      * **hostIP** ``str`` - *(optional)* hostIP holds the IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if
        the pod has not started yet. A pod can be assigned to a node that has a
        problem in kubelet which in turns mean that HostIP will not be updated even if
        there is a node is assigned to pod
      * **hostIPs** ``List[HostIP]`` - *(optional)* hostIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the host. If this field is
        specified, the first entry must match the hostIP field. This list is empty if
        the pod has not started yet. A pod can be assigned to a node that has a
        problem in kubelet which in turns means that HostIPs will not be updated even
        if there is a node is assigned to this pod.
      * **initContainerStatuses** ``List[ContainerStatus]`` - *(optional)* The list has one entry per init container in the manifest. The most recent
        successful init container will have ready = true, the most recently started
        container will have startTime set. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status
      * **message** ``str`` - *(optional)* A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        condition.
      * **nominatedNodeName** ``str`` - *(optional)* nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node,
        but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their
        graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod will
        be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if
        other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the
        resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after
        preemption. As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName
        when the pod is scheduled.
      * **phase** ``str`` - *(optional)* The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
        lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the
        individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
        There are five possible phase values:
        Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more
        of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being
        scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which
        could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the
        containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is
        in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod
        have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers
        in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in
        failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by
        the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be
        obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase
      * **podIP** ``str`` - *(optional)* podIP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster.
        Empty if not yet allocated.
      * **podIPs** ``List[PodIP]`` - *(optional)* podIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the pod. If this field is
        specified, the 0th entry must match the podIP field. Pods may be allocated at
        most 1 value for each of IPv4 and IPv6. This list is empty if no IPs have been
        allocated yet.
      * **qosClass** ``str`` - *(optional)* The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on
        resource requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#quality-of-service-classes
      * **reason** ``str`` - *(optional)* A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        state. e.g. 'Evicted'
      * **resize** ``str`` - *(optional)* Status of resources resize desired for pod's containers. It is empty if no
        resources resize is pending. Any changes to container resources will
        automatically set this to "Proposed"
      * **resourceClaimStatuses** ``List[PodResourceClaimStatus]`` - *(optional)* Status of resource claims.
      * **startTime** ``meta_v1.Time`` - *(optional)* RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet.
        This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.

      PodSecurityContext.  When both are set, the values in SecurityContext take
      precedence.

      **parameters**

      * **allowPrivilegeEscalation** ``bool`` - *(optional)* AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain more privileges
        than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the no_new_privs flag
        will be set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always
        when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN Note that
        this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **capabilities** ``Capabilities`` - *(optional)* The capabilities to add/drop when running containers. Defaults to the default
        set of capabilities granted by the container runtime. Note that this field
        cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **privileged** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Run container in privileged mode. Processes in privileged containers are
        essentially equivalent to root on the host. Defaults to false. Note that this
        field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **procMount** ``str`` - *(optional)* procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The
        default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for
        readonly paths and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag
        to be enabled. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
      * **readOnlyRootFilesystem** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Whether this container has a read-only root filesystem. Default is false. Note
        that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **runAsGroup** ``int`` - *(optional)* The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default
        if unset. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
      * **runAsNonRoot** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet
        will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
        (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
        validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set
        in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence.
      * **runAsUser** ``int`` - *(optional)* The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in
        PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext,
        the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field
        cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **seLinuxOptions** ``SELinuxOptions`` - *(optional)* The SELinux context to be applied to the container. If unspecified, the
        container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.
        May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **seccompProfile** ``SeccompProfile`` - *(optional)* The seccomp options to use by this container. If seccomp options are provided
        at both the pod & container level, the container options override the pod
        options. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
      * **windowsOptions** ``WindowsSecurityContextOptions`` - *(optional)* The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the
        options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is

      * **externalIPs** ``List[str]`` - *(optional)* externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also
        accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.
        The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this
        IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the
        Kubernetes system.
      * **externalName** ``str`` - *(optional)* externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will return
        as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be
        involved.  Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname
        (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires `type` to be
        "ExternalName".
      * **externalTrafficPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
        receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
        ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will
        configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will
        take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node
        will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without
        masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no
        endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard
        behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and
        other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP
        from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients
        sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy
        into account when picking a node.
      * **healthCheckNodePort** ``int`` - *(optional)* healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. This
        only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and externalTrafficPolicy is set
        to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and is not in use, it will be
        used.  If not specified, a value will be automatically allocated.  External
        systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine if a given node
        holds endpoints for this service or not.  If this field is specified when
        creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will
        be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type).
        This field cannot be updated once set.
      * **internalTrafficPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* InternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
        receive on the ClusterIP. If set to "Local", the proxy will assume that pods
        only want to talk to endpoints of the service on the same node as the pod,
        dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,
        "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly
        (possibly modified by topology and other features).
      * **ipFamilies** ``List[str]`` - *(optional)* IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
        service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
        configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified
        manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy
        allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This
        field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary
        IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the
        Service. Valid values are "IPv4" and "IPv6".  This field only applies to
        Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to
        "headless" services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type
        ExternalName.
        This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either
        order).  These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field,
        if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the
        ipFamilyPolicy field.
      * **ipFamilyPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this
        Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to
        SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family),
        "PreferDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a
        single IP family on single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack" (two IP
        families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies
        and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field. This field will be
        wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName.
      * **loadBalancerClass** ``str`` - *(optional)* loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation this
        Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a
        label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. "internal-vip" or
        "example.com/internal-vip". Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This
        field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the
        default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done
        through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default
        implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is
        watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
        implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this
        field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type
        'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when
        a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.
      * **loadBalancerIP** ``str`` - *(optional)* Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer. This feature depends on whether
        the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a
        load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider
        does not support the feature. Deprecated: This field was under-specified and
        its meaning varies across implementations. Using it is non-portable and it may
        not support dual-stack. Users are encouraged to use implementation-specific
        annotations when available.
      * **loadBalancerSourceRanges** ``List[str]`` - *(optional)* If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through
        the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client
        IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the
        feature." More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
      * **ports** ``List[ServicePort]`` - *(optional)* The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
      * **publishNotReadyAddresses** ``bool`` - *(optional)* publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints
        for this Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready. The
        primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless
        Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer
        discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and
        EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints
        are considered "ready" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which
        consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or
        EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.
      * **selector** ``dict`` - *(optional)* Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this
        selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external
        process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies
        to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is
        ExternalName. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
      * **sessionAffinity** ``str`` - *(optional)* Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable
        client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None.
        More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
      * **sessionAffinityConfig** ``SessionAffinityConfig`` - *(optional)* sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity.
      * **type** ``str`` - *(optional)* type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
        options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ClusterIP"
        allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
        Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by
        manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If
        clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are
        published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on
        ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same
        endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an
        external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the
        same endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases this service to the
        specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName
        services. More info:

    """TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given

      **parameters**

      * **maxSkew** ``int`` - MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When
        `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global
        minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an
        eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than
        MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
        with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum
        is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1,
        incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it
        onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate
        MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
        to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0
        is not allowed.
      * **topologyKey** ``str`` - TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider
        each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into
        each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also,
        we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is
        "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if
        TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that
        topology. It's a required field.
      * **whenUnsatisfiable** ``str`` - WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the
        spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to
        schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any
        location,
          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
          skew.
        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if
        every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some
        topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with
        the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |
        P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can
        only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be
        imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required
        field.
      * **labelSelector** ``meta_v1.LabelSelector`` - *(optional)* LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label
        selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding
        topology domain.
      * **matchLabelKeys** ``List[str]`` - *(optional)* MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
        spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to
        select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for
        the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys
        and LabelSelector. MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or
        empty list means only match against labelSelector.
        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread
        feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
      * **minDomains** ``int`` - *(optional)* MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of
        eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod
        Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew
        is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology
        keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on
        scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than
        minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid
        values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable
        must be DoNotSchedule.
        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5
        and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3
        | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains),
        so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same
        labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if
        new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.
        This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature
        gate to be enabled (enabled by default).
      * **nodeAffinityPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector
        when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes
        matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore:
        nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the
        calculations.
        If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is
        a beta-level feature default enabled by the
        NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.
      * **nodeTaintsPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod
        topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with
        tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. -
        Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.
        If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is
        a beta-level feature default enabled by the
        NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

      * **emptyDir** ``EmptyDirVolumeSource`` - *(optional)* emptyDir represents a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime. More
        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir
      * **ephemeral** ``EphemeralVolumeSource`` - *(optional)* ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver. The
        volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created
        before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed.
        Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of
        normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
           tracking are needed,
        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage
        driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
           information on the connection between this volume type
           and PersistentVolumeClaim).
        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that
        persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.
        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information.
        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the
        same time.
      * **fc** ``FCVolumeSource`` - *(optional)* fc represents a Fibre Channel resource that is attached to a kubelet's host
        machine and then exposed to the pod.

        is directly exposed to the container. This is generally used for system agents
        or other privileged things that are allowed to see the host machine. Most
        containers will NOT need this. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#hostpath
      * **iscsi** ``ISCSIVolumeSource`` - *(optional)* iscsi represents an ISCSI Disk resource that is attached to a kubelet's host
