PunkEditor
==========

Consider vi as Beethoven, Emacs as Charlie Parker, and VS Code as Rush. In mom's garage, on cheap instruments, a band of teens rehearses a few hastily-scribed 3-chord songs for their first gig. Meet PunkEditor.

Installation
------------

For command line version only: `pipx install punkeditor`

To use the code library: `pip3 install punkeditor` (or add to your `requirements.txt` etc).

Use
---

We only have a prototype at the moment. It's a variation on the curses TextBox class.

The command is:

```
punke
```

This will open the editor in full-screen with an empty buffer. Try emacs-type keys to see what works. Hit **Enter** to quit. The command will dump the contents of the buffer to the output after quitting.
