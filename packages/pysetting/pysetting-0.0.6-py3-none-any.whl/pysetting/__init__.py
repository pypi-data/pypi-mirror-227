# IMPORTS
from .pysetting import * # since this package (running) contains a single module (pysetting.py), flatten the module so that users can access items within the module pysetting.py by using just the package name (pysetting.<entity>) instead of having to add the module name too (pysetting.pysetting.<entity>)
