## Typing stubs for pluggy

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pluggy` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pluggy`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pluggy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `pluggy` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.3.0. Please uninstall the `types-pluggy`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `94ddcf87dac61ff2626f995d8ee8c6f3402d5cb7` and was tested
with mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.323, and
pytype 2023.8.14.
