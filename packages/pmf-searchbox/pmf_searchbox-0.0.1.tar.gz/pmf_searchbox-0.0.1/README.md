This is a simple example package.
You can have a Searchbox in tkinter using this package for your tkinter apps.
In Searchbox, if you type part of an item and then click on the button, you will only see the items which contain that text and you can find items easily. Another item which is added to attributes, is the sort attribute. If you use sort=True, the result items which are shown are sorted, otherwise, they will appear in the same order where you have listed them in the values attribute.
