# TOSA Checker

## Overview

The TOSA Checker is a tool that provides an easy way to ensure that a TensorFlow™ Lite model is compatible with the [TOSA specification](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa).

The project is currently in alpha, some stability issues may still be found.

## Prerequisites

To build the TOSA Checker the following are required:

* Ubuntu® 20.04.03 LTS (the TOSA Checker has been tested on this OS, but should work on other Linux® OS)
* Bazel™ (Bazelisk is an easy way to install the correct version of Bazel™)
* Git™
* Python® >=3.8 (python, python-dev and python-pip)

## Building and installation

```
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U numpy GitPython
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/<tosa_checker>.whl
```

## Docker™ image

A Docker™ image to build the TOSA Checker is also provided. More information can be found on [docker/README.md](https://review.mlplatform.org/plugins/gitiles/tosa/tosa_checker/+/refs/tags/0.2.0/docker/README.md).

## Usage

```python
>>> import tosa_checker as tc
>>> checker = tc.TOSAChecker(model_path="model.tflite")
>>> checker.is_tosa_compatible()
True
```

## Security

To report any security issue in the TOSA Checker, please see [SECURITY.md](https://review.mlplatform.org/plugins/gitiles/tosa/tosa_checker/+/refs/tags/0.2.0/SECURITY.md).
