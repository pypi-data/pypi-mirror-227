# tomodo


**tomodo** is a **To**olbox for **Mo**ngoDB on **Do**cker.

Use it upgrade existing standalone MongoDB deployments or
[MongoDB Replica Sets](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/)
deployed with Docker.

## Installation

You can install the tool using the [tomodo PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/tomodo/)
with pip:

```bash
pip install tomodo
```

## How Upgrades Work

Upgrading MongoDB is officially supported through specific upgrade paths.
For example, in order to upgrade a MongoDB database from version 3.6 to version
6.0, one _cannot_ do it in a one-off upgrade.  Instead, there's a specific, well-documented
upgrade path for each upgrade. For example:

- Upgrading to version 4.0 can only be done from version 3.6 or later (see [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.0-upgrade-replica-set/#upgrade-version-path))
- Upgrading to version 4.2 can only be done from version 4.0 or later (see [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.2-upgrade-replica-set/#upgrade-version-path))
- Upgrading to version 4.4 can only be done from version 4.2 or later (see [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.4-upgrade-replica-set/#upgrade-version-path))
- etc.

For this reason, if the process of upgrading from your current MongoDB version to a target version
requires five hops (e.g., 3.6.x to 6.0.x), `tomodo` will perform five upgrades, one after
the other.

## Usage

### MongoDB Version Upgrade

Below is a simplified example of a `tomodo` command you can run
in order to upgrade a locally-deployed MongoDB Replica Set to
version 4.4:

```bash
tomodo \
  --no-standalone \
  --target-version 5.0 \
  --hostname "mongodb://mongodb-rs-1:27011/?replicaSet=mongodbrs"
```

## Set Up a Test Environment

In order to test the tool locally, you can create a local [MongoDB
Replica Set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/) and upgrade it.

1. First, create a Docker network for your test deployment:

    ```bash
    docker network create mongodbnet > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Network already exists"
    ````

2. Next, deploy a MongoDB Replica Set with N members (3 members in the example below):

    ```bash
    members=3
    mongodb_ver=3.6.18
    for ((i=1; i<=members; i++)); do
      rm -rf ./data/db${i}/* || echo 'Nothing to clean up'
      mkdir -p ./data/db${i}
      docker run -d \
        -v $(pwd)/data/db${i}:/data/db${i} \
        -h mongodb-rs-${i} \
        --network-alias mongodb-rs-${i} \
        --name mongodb-rs-${i} \
        -u 1000:1000 \
        -p "2701${i}:2701${i}" \
        --network mongodbnet \
        mongo:${mongodb_ver} \
        --dbpath /data/db${i} \
        --replSet mongodbrs \
        --bind_ip_all \
        --logpath /data/db${i}/mongod.log \
        --port 2701${i}
    done
    ```

3. Initialize a MongoDB Replica Set (replace the value of `members` if you chose a member count
   that's different from `3`:

    ```bash
    members=3
    hosts="127.0.0.1   mongodb-rs-1"
    init_script="rs.initiate()"
    for ((i=2; i<=members; i++)); do
      init_script="${init_script}; rs.add('mongodb-rs-${i}:2701${i}')"
      hosts="${hosts},mongodb-rs-${i}"
    done
    mongosh \
      --quiet "mongodb://mongodb-rs-1:27011" \
      --eval "${init_script}"
    ```

4. Optional, but recommended: add the host mapping to the containers:

   ```bash
   hosts="127.0.0.1   mongodb-rs-1"
   for ((i=2; i<=members; i++)); do
      hosts="${hosts},mongodb-rs-${i}"
    done
   echo $hosts | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

5. Verify the deployment was successful by running the following `docker` command:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   
   The output should be along the following lines:
   ```bash
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                                 NAMES
   36ddd65fe63a   mongo:3.6.18   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:27013->27013/tcp, 27017/tcp   mongodb-rs-3
   0e9d3b357be9   mongo:3.6.18   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:27012->27012/tcp, 27017/tcp   mongodb-rs-2
   d7f43e5b0003   mongo:3.6.18   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:27011->27011/tcp, 27017/tcp   mongodb-rs-1
   ```

6. Now that the Replica Set is initialized, you can connect to it using `mongosh`:

   ```bash
   mongosh \
   "mongodb://mongodb-rs-1:27011,mongodb-rs-2:27012,mongodb-rs-3:27013/?replicaSet=mongodbrs"
   ``` 

## Outstanding Tasks:

- [ ] Support rollbacks on failure
- [ ] Support downgrades
- [ ] Support Replica Set upgrades with multiple remote docker hosts
- [ ] Customizable container selection (e.g., by name/ID)
- [ ] Support configuration file
