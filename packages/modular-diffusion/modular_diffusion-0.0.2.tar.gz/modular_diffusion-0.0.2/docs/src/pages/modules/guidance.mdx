In Diffusion Models, guidance mechanisms control how much importance the model gives to the conditioning information, at the cost of sample diversity. The two most prevalent forms of guidance are **Classifier Guidance** and **Classifier-Free Guidance**. As of right now, Modular Diffusion only ships with the latter, **but will support both in an upcoming release.**

## Classifier-free guidance

Classifier-free guidance was introduced in [Ho & Salimans. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598) where it was found to produce higher fidelity samples in **conditional** Diffusion Models. It modifies the diffusion process as follows:

- During **training**, a random subset of the batch labels are dropped, i.e., replaced with 0, before each epoch.
- During **sampling**, predicted values $\hat{x}_\theta$ are computed according to $\hat{x}_\theta = (1 + s)\cdot\hat{x}_\theta(x_t|y) - s\cdot\hat{x}_\theta(x_t|0)$

where $s$ is a scalar parameter that controls the strength of the guidance signal.

### Parameters

- `dropout` -> Percentage of labels dropped during training.
- `strength` -> Strength of the guidance signal $s$.

### Example

```python
from diffusion.guidance import ClassifierFree

guidance = ClassifierFree(dropout=0.1, strength=2)
```
