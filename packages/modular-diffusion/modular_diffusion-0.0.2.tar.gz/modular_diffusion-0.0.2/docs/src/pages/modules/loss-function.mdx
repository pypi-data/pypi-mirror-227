The loss function of the denoising network seems to play a crucial role in the quality of the samples generated by Diffusion Models. Modular Diffusion ships with the reoccurring $L_\text{simple}$ and $L_\text{vlb}$ functions, as well as a `Lambda` utility to build your own custom loss function.

> Hybrid losses
>
> To create a hybrid loss, simply add different loss modules together with a weight. For instance, to create a loss function that is a combination of $L_\text{simple}$ and $L_\text{vlb}$, you could write `loss = Simple() + 0.001 * VLB()`.

## Training batch

While not a loss module, the `Batch` object is a fundamental component of Modular Diffusion. It is used to store the data that is fed to the loss module during training. When creating custom loss modules, it is important to know the names used to refer to the different tensors stored in the `Batch` object, listed below.

### Properties

- `w` -> Initial data tensor $w$.
- `x` -> Data tensor after transform $x_0$.
- `y` -> Label tensor $y$.
- `t` -> Time step tensor $t$.
- `epsilon` -> Noise tensor $\epsilon$. May be `None` for certain noise types.
- `z` -> Latent tensor $x_t$.
- `hat` -> Predicted tensor $\hat{x}_\theta$, $\hat{\epsilon}_\theta$, or other(s) depending on the parametrization.
- `q` -> Posterior distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$.
- `p` -> Approximate posterior distribution $p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$.

## Lambda function

Custom loss module that is defined using a lambda function and parametrized with a distribution. It is meant to be used as shorthand for writing a custom loss function class.

### Parameters

- `function` -> Callable which receives a `Batch` object and returns a `Tensor` containing the loss value.

### Example

```python
from diffusion.loss import Lambda
from diffusion.distribution import Normal as N

loss = Lambda[N](lambda b: ((b.q.mu - b.p.mu)**2).mean())
```

> Type checking
>
> If you are using a type checker or want useful intellisense, you will need to explicitly parametrize the `Lambda` class with a `Distribution` type as seen in the example.

## Simple loss function

Simple MSE loss introduced by [Ho et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) in the context of Diffusion Models. Depending on the parametrization, it is defined as:

- $L_\text{simple}=\mathbb{E}\left[\lvert\lvert x-\hat{x}_\theta\rvert\rvert^2\right]$
- $L_\text{simple}=\mathbb{E}\left[\lvert\lvert\epsilon-\hat{\epsilon}_\theta\rvert\rvert^2\right]$.

### Parameters

- `parameter` (default `"x"`) -> Parameter to be learned and used to compute the loss. Either `"x"` ($\hat{x}_\theta$) or `"epsilon"` ($\hat{\epsilon}_\theta$).
- `index` (default `0`) -> Index of the `hat` tensor which corresponds to the selected `parameter`.

> Parametrization
>
> If you have the option, always remember to select the same parameter both in your model's `Noise` and `Loss` objects.

### Example

```python
from diffusion.loss import Simple

loss = Simple(parameter="epsilon")
```

## Variational lower bound

In the context of Diffusion Models, the variational lower bound (VLB) of $\log p(x_0)$ is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}L_\text{vlb} & = \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1}|x_0)}\left[\log p_{\theta}(x_0|x_1)\right] \\ & - \sum_{t=2}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{q(x_{t}|x_0)}\left[D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)||p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t))\right] \\ & - D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0)||p(x_T))\text{,}\end{aligned}$$

where $D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0)||p(x_T))$ is considered to be equal to 0 under standard assumptions.

### Parameters

*This module has no parameters.*

### Example

```python
from diffusion.loss import VLB

loss = VLB()
```
